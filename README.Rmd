# üèπ arcMS Parquet data visualization app

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

This Shiny app provides an interface to quickly visualize HRMS data converted to Parquet files with the [arcMS package](https://github.com/leesulab/arcMS).

Input data must be a table in the [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) format and created with the `arcMS` package.

Data is not fully loaded in RAM but chromatograms and MS spectra are quickly retrieved from the parquet file with the [Apache Arrow library](https://arrow.apache.org/).
